# Pytorch Lightning Template

I'm a big fan of Pytorch Lightning, but wish in some cases it was even more like Keras API,
so made a very thin wrapper for the training and validation functions. 

You specify the accuracy, optimizer, loss functions (just like it Keras) and this wrapper
will seemlessly run like Keras.
